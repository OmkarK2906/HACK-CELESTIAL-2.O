Phase 6 — Hotel inventory.

Everything up to here works at zone level, which is the right grain for a
control room but useless to a visitor: nobody books a zone. This layer puts two
properties in every zone and derives their live state from the zone's occupancy,
so the operator view and the attendee view are reading the same numbers.

A property's badge is earned, not assigned:

  HOT   its zone is filling fast and rooms are going
  GEM   well rated, still quiet, and nobody has found it yet
  SAVE  materially cheaper than staying at the venue

The saving is real: it is measured against the venue zone's average rate, which
is what a visitor pays for the convenience of not moving.
