"""
Phase 2 — Forecasting engine.

Projects zone occupancy forward and works out how long until each zone hits
saturation.

Deliberately simple and explainable: a weighted linear trend over recent
history, with the recent hours weighted more heavily than older ones. This is
defensible in a live demo in a way a black-box model is not — when a judge asks
"why does it predict that?", you can answer in one sentence.
